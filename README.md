# project name: lilog
the name: it is combitation of linux and keylogger.
Yes! a keylogger on linux. I make it for a big exercise on my class. I don't want to make a "bad" project to break a system.
So! this project for study purpose. Please don't hate me.

## problem
- how linux manage message
- how to hook
- write key to log
- send log to host
